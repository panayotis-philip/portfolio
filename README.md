## Projects
### Dynamic Hangman: Book-Inspired Word Challenges


Developed an enhanced version of the classic Hangman game in Java, integrating a REST API (WORKS API from BOOKS API) to dynamically source words based on book descriptions from an extensive library. Players can select a book, generating a custom word list for their game. Each turn, players choose letters from a selection, with probabilities dynamically calculated and updated to reflect each player’s progress. Points are awarded based on the rarity of correctly guessed letters, adding a strategic element to the gameplay. The game features an interactive JavaFX interface and includes comprehensive word usage statistics for each book-based dictionary.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
